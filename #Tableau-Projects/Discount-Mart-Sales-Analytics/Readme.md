# Project Brief: Discount Mart

## Objective
- Discount mart is a small supermarket owned by Grant Frost. He wants a dashboard where he can track how well Discount Mart is doing for this year (in terms of Sales, Profit and Quantity Sold).
- He would also like to know how well categories are performing as well as different regions.
- Grant Frost assumes that most customers buy 2 or more products per basket/order but would like this confirmed by the data.
- Grant also noted that Profit is 30% of the selling price.
